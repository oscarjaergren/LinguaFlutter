# ============================================================================
# Full CI/CD Pipeline
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Comprehensive testing and building for all platforms
# Triggers: Push to master/develop branches, PRs to master
# 
# What it does:
# 1. Analyze & Lint: Check code quality and formatting
# 2. Test: Run unit tests with coverage reporting
# 3. Build: Create builds for Web, Windows, Android, iOS
# 4. Integration Tests: Run integration tests with Docker infrastructure
# 5. Security Scan: Check for dependency vulnerabilities
#
# WARNING: This is a HEAVY workflow - runs on every push to master/develop
# Consider using dev-ci.yml for lighter checks on feature branches
