# ============================================================================
# Development CI - Quick Checks
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Fast feedback for development branches
# Triggers: Push to develop/feature/* branches, PRs to develop
# 
# What it does:
# 1. Quick formatting check
# 2. Code analysis
# 3. Run unit tests (no integration tests)
# 4. Quick web build in debug mode (faster than release)
#
# This is a LIGHTER workflow than ci-cd.yml - designed for rapid feedback
# during development without consuming too many GitHub Actions minutes
# ============================================================================
