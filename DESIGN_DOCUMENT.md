## Project Overview

LinguaFlutter is a modern Flutter-based language learning application focused on spaced repetition card review. The app emphasizes clean architecture, maintainable code, and excellent user experience through book-like interactions and smooth animations.

### Core Goals
- **Learning Effectiveness**: Implement proven spaced repetition algorithms
- **User Experience**: Create immersive, book-like card review experience
- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, testable, and scalable architecture
- **Performance**: Ensure smooth 60fps animations and responsive UI

## Vertical Slice Architecture

### What is Vertical Slice Architecture?

Vertical Slice Architecture organizes code by **features** rather than technical layers. Each feature contains all the code needed to implement a complete user scenario, from UI to data persistence.

### Benefits in LinguaFlutter

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature is self-contained and can be developed independently
2. **Reduced Coupling**: Features communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. **Team Scalability**: Different developers can work on different features without conflicts
4. **Easier Testing**: Each slice can be tested in isolation
5. **Faster Development**: Changes are localized to specific features

### Implementation Strategy

```
lib/
├── features/           # Vertical slices - each feature is complete
│   ├── card_management/
│   ├── card_review/
│   ├── streak/
│   └── mascot/
├── shared/            # Horizontal concerns shared across features
│   ├── domain/
│   ├── services/
│   └── widgets/
└── main.dart
```

## Feature-Based Organization

### Feature Structure

Each feature follows a consistent internal structure:

```
features/[feature_name]/
├── domain/           # Business logic, providers, models
│   ├── providers/
│   └── models/
├── data/            # Data access, repositories, services
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── services/
├── presentation/    # UI components, screens, widgets
│   ├── screens/
│   └── widgets/
├── design/         # Feature-specific design documents
└── test/          # Co-located tests
```

### Feature Communication

Features communicate through:
- **Shared Services**: Common functionality in `lib/shared/services/`
- **Provider Dependencies**: Injected through constructor parameters
- **Event System**: For loose coupling between features
- **Navigation**: Centralized routing configuration

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Dependency Injection
- Use constructor injection for testability
- Avoid service locators and global state
- Example: `AnimationService` injection in `MascotWidget`

### 2. Single Responsibility
- Each class has one reason to change
- Features handle one specific user capability
- Services handle one specific technical concern

### 3. Interface Segregation
- Abstract classes define contracts
- Multiple small interfaces over large ones
- Example: `AnimationService` with production/test implementations

### 4. Separation of Concerns
- **Domain**: Business rules and logic
- **Data**: External data access and persistence
- **Presentation**: UI and user interaction

### 5. Testability First
- All dependencies are injectable
- Business logic is separated from UI
- Test doubles can replace any dependency

## Exercise System

### Overview

The exercise system allows cards to be practiced in multiple ways, each testing different language skills. Each exercise type maintains independent scoring to track mastery across different practice modes.

### Exercise Types

#### Implemented Exercises

1. **Reading Recognition** (`ExerciseType.readingRecognition`)
   - View the word and recall its meaning
   - Tests: Recognition, visual memory
   - Benefits from having an icon
   - Icon: `mdi:book-open-page-variant`

2. **Writing Translation** (`ExerciseType.writingTranslation`)
   - Type the correct translation of the word
   - Tests: Spelling, active recall, writing skills
   - Icon: `mdi:pencil`

3. **Multiple Choice (Text)** (`ExerciseType.multipleChoiceText`)
   - Select the correct translation from text options
   - Tests: Recognition, comprehension
   - Icon: `mdi:format-list-checks`

4. **Multiple Choice (Icon)** (`ExerciseType.multipleChoiceIcon`)
   - Select the correct icon that represents the word
   - Tests: Visual association, meaning comprehension
   - Requires the card to have an icon
   - Icon: `mdi:image-multiple`

5. **Reverse Translation** (`ExerciseType.reverseTranslation`)
   - Translate from native language to target language
   - Tests: Active production, harder recall
   - Icon: `mdi:swap-horizontal`

#### Future Exercise Types

1. **Listening Recognition** (`ExerciseType.listeningRecognition`)
   - Listen to audio and identify the correct word
   - Tests: Listening comprehension, pronunciation recognition
   - Requires audio integration
   - Icon: `mdi:ear-hearing`

2. **Speaking Pronunciation** (`ExerciseType.speakingPronunciation`)
   - Speak the word and receive pronunciation feedback
   - Tests: Speaking skills, pronunciation accuracy
   - Requires speech recognition
   - Icon: `mdi:microphone`

3. **Sentence Fill** (`ExerciseType.sentenceFill`)
   - Fill in the blank in a sentence with the correct word
   - Tests: Context usage, grammar
   - Requires sentence examples
   - Icon: `mdi:text-box`

### Exercise Scoring

#### ExerciseScore Model

Each `ExerciseScore` tracks:
- **correctCount**: Number of successful attempts (+1 per success)
- **incorrectCount**: Number of failed attempts (+1 per failure)
- **lastPracticed**: Timestamp of last practice
- **nextReview**: Scheduled review date (spaced repetition)
- **successRate**: Percentage of correct answers
- **masteryLevel**: 'New', 'Learning', 'Good', 'Mastered', or 'Difficult'
- **netScore**: `correctCount - incorrectCount`

#### Spaced Repetition

Each exercise type uses independent spaced repetition:
- **Correct answer**: Review interval increases based on success rate
- **Incorrect answer**: Review again tomorrow
- Formula: `intervalDays = baseDays * (1 + multiplier * 2)`

#### CardModel Integration

The `CardModel` now includes:
```dart
final Map<ExerciseType, ExerciseScore> exerciseScores;
```

New methods:
- `getExerciseScore(ExerciseType)`: Get score for specific exercise
- `overallMasteryLevel`: Aggregate mastery across all exercises
- `isExerciseDue(ExerciseType)`: Check if exercise needs review
- `dueExerciseTypes`: List of exercises due for review
- `copyWithExerciseResult()`: Update card with exercise result

### Exercise Selection Strategy

When starting a practice session:
1. Filter cards by due date
2. For each card, get `dueExerciseTypes`
3. Select exercise types that:
   - Are implemented
   - Are due for review
   - Have requirements met (e.g., icon for icon-based exercises)
4. Prioritize exercises with lower mastery levels

### Usage Example

```dart
// Recording an exercise result
final card = CardModel.create(...);
final updatedCard = card.copyWithExerciseResult(
  exerciseType: ExerciseType.writingTranslation,
  wasCorrect: true,
);

// Checking due exercises
final dueExercises = card.dueExerciseTypes;
if (card.isExerciseDue(ExerciseType.readingRecognition)) {
  // Practice this exercise
}

// Getting specific exercise performance
final score = card.getExerciseScore(ExerciseType.multipleChoiceText);
print('Success rate: ${score?.successRate}%');
```
